Here is our main code of recent work VG-Cap.  Compared with [ER-SAN](https://github.com/CrossmodalGroup/ER-SAN), we propose a new image relation features representation and language prediction method with significant modifications, Specifically

- We exploit the novel visual graph topology to calculate the shortest path distance between two objects as the inductive structure-aware relation bias, which explicitly improves the structural relations between object regions.
- We propose a novel semantic fusion prediction module that selectively focuses on contextual visual and semantic relation features to generate accurate semantic words.
