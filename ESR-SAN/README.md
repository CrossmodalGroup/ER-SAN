Here is our main code of recent work ESR-SAN. Compared with ER-SAN, we propose a new image relation features representation and language prediction method with significant modifications, Specifically

- We exploit the novel visual graph topology as the inductive structure-aware relation bias, which explicitly improves the structural relations between object regions.
- For the language prediction stage, we further leverage semantic relation in the Transformer decoder for non-visual word prediction. We demonstrate that explicit semantic relations can enhance not only visual relations in the encoder stage but also enrich semantic word generation.
